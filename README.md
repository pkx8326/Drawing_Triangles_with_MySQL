# Drawing_Triangles_with_MySQL
This repository contains simple sets of codes that draw triangles in the form of ASCII art using MySQL. I cam across these codes on HackerRank and I thought it was a very strange concept to SQL to draw triangles with ASCII art. But then it became a challenging tasks and I learned to use information_schema.tables, a dummy table that exists in every MySQL session.
